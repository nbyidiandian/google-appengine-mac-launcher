This project contains source code for the launcher, a Cocoa based
developer tool for creating, running, and deploying Google App Engine
applications.  This launcher is included in the the App Engine SDK for
Mac.  The launcher delivered with the App Engine Windows SDK,
GoogleAppEngineLauncher.exe, is also open source:

An xcodeproj which compiles this launcher outside of the Google build
environment will be available shortly.
